November 17, 2008:<br />
New version: 0.1.7<br />
Severali minor bugs fixed.<br />
Pacakged prepared for CRAN<br />
<p />

September 4, 2008:<br />
Bug in the fortran code for two-mode networks fixed.<br />
Optimization of partitions for sum of squares blockmodeling for structural equivalence now implemeted in FORTRAN (runs much faster) also for two-mode multirelational networks.
<p />

August 2, 2008:<br />
New version: 0.1.6<br />
Severali minor bugs fixed.<br />
Optimization of partitions for sum of squares blockmodeling for structural equivalence now implemeted in FORTRAN (runs much faster) also for two-mode networks.
<p />

May 18, 2008:<br />
In helpfile for function "crit.fun" had such description for the argument "FUN": "(default = "max") Function f used in row-f-regular, column-f-regular, and f-regular blocks. Not used in binary approach. For multi-relational networks, it can be a vector of such character strings." The last sentence was not yet implemetned (I guess I missed it) - now it is.
<p />

May 17, 2008:<br />
Function "gen.opt.par" (a function used whenever we are optimizing a partition) modified in such a way that it allows us to specify a function "parOK" (and it's parameters) which can check if each partition is allowed prior to its evaluation. Very useful if we want forbid some kind of partition (e.g. - boys can not mix with girls).
<p />

May 6, 2008:<br />
A bug in the way partitions were generated in function "opt.random.par" fixed.<br />
Function "opt.random.par" modified in a way that not it is possible to specify a function that will generate random partitions.<br />
New function "genRandomPar" for gereration of random partition added (mainly ported from "opt.random.par").
<p />

January 26, 2008:<br />
New version: 0.1.5<br />
Several minor bugs fixed.<br />
New functionality - for homogeneity blockmodeling, it is now possible to specify prespecified central values as fixes, as a minimal value that the central value can be or as a maximal value that central value can be. For now, specification  has to be in the from of of an 3d array. With the correct specification of BLOCKS, BLOCKS.CV and CV.use, we can have several alternative centar values for the same block types. E.g. we can have to complete blocks with different central values (e.g. 3 and 10) as compiting block types.
<p />

January 2, 2008:<br />
Several minor bugs fixed.<br />
New function "loadpajek"
<p />

February 8, 2007:<br />
A new function "partitions" added that extracts all "best" partitions found by functions such as "opt.par", "opt.these.par", "opt.random.par" and "check.these.par".
<p />

January 31, 2007:<br />
Several minor bugs fixed.
<p />

January 25, 2007:<br />
Methods for finding random partitions from Pajek incorporated. Bug in “gen.opt.par” fixed.
<p />

January 16, 2007:<br />
Several bugs fixed.
<p />

December 8, 2006:<br />
Several bugs fixed.
<p />

November 29, 2006:<br />
Several bugs fixed and new function "reorderImage" added.
<p />

October 20, 2006:<br />
Several bugs fixed.
<p />

October 11, 2006:<br />
New version: 0.1.4<br />
Several bugs fixed.<br />
3 versions of row- and column-dominant blocks for homogeneity blockmodeling implemented.<br />
Multirelational networks now supported.<br />
Support for using a combination of several approaches to blockmodeling.<br />
Option to analyze row and column normalized versions of the original network instead of the original one.<br />
Some new support functions.<br />
Many slow functions (opt.random.par, opt.these.par, check.these.par) changed to that if Esc presed during the execution, most of the results are saved.
<p />

July 5, 2006:<br />
Several bugs fixed.<br />
Different default behavior of "imp" - implicit approach.
<p />

April 11, 2006:<br />
Several bugs in “opt.random.par” and a few in “gen.crit.fun” concerning two-mode networks fixed.
<p />

April 8, 2006:<br />
A several bugs fixed in “gen.crit.fun”, a function used by all functions that compute inconsistencies for blockmodels.
<p />

April 3, 2006:<br />
A bug fixed in fortran code used by “crit.fun” and “check.these.par” for Sum of squares blockmodeling with only complete blocks.<br />
A bug fixed in "sedist".
<p />

March 23, 2006:<br />
A bug fixed in “plot.mat”<br />
<p />
