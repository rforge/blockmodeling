#' @title The notes borrowing network between social-informatics students
#'
#' @description
#' The data come from a survey conducted in May 1993 on 13 social-informatics students (Hlebec, 1996).
#' The network was constructed from answers to the question, "How often did you borrow notes from this person?" for each of the fellow students.
#' The respondents indicated the frequency of borrowing by choosing (on a computer) a line of length 1-20, where 1 meant no borrowing. 1 was deducted from all answers, so that 0 now means no borrowing.
#' The data was first used for blockmodeling in Žiberna (2007).
#' 
#' @format The data set is a valued matrix with 13 rows and columns.
