#' This example consists of the citation data between social 
#' work journals for the 1985-86 period, collected and analyzed 
#' in Baker (1992) – see Table 3 below. The dataset covers 20 
#' journals and the valued directional ties represents the total
#' number of (discrete) directional citations between and within
#' journals. Tie values range between 2 and 356, with a mean,
#' median and standard deviation of, respectively, 33.6, 16,
#' and 48.9. Apart from Baker’s original analysis, the dataset
#' has been used as an example to demonstrate core-periphery
#' heuristics (Borgatti & Everett, 2000), 2-mode generalized
#' blockmodeling (Doreian, Batagelj, & Ferligoj, 2005, p. 267ff),
#' and the direct and indirect deviational blockmodeling approach (Nordlund, 2016),
#'  latter studies that exclude the diagonal values.
