November 23, 2018
Version 0.3.4
Added functions for k-means one-mode blockmodeling and some helper functions EXPERIMENTAL!!!.

November 9, 2018
Bug fixed in critFunC.

November 7, 2018
Version 0.3.3
Corrected documentation on critFunC and optParC in the part on using argument "approaches". Also, the functions were updated so that "ss" and "ad" are accepted as values of the approaches argument (which was previously documented, but not supported).

Function EM that extract the error matrix was added.

November 5, 2018
Version 0.3.2
Some minor bug fixes, performance improvements and documentation improvements.

April 25, 2018
Version 0.3.1

April 10, 2018
Version 0.3.0
Final tweaks before submission to CRAN.
Making sna Suggested package (and not one dependent upon).

March 28, 2018
Correcting some FORTRAN warnings.

			 
March 2, 2018
Version 0.2.4
Added help files for functions optRandomParC and critFunC.
Updated help files (e.g. helpfile for function optParC was inserted (combined) in help file of function critFunC).
Added new functions plotMat, plotArray and plotMatNm which are equivalent to the old functions plot.mat, plot.array and plot.mat.nm. The old functions will eventually be replaced with the new functions.

A bug in sedist fixed

2013
Version: 0.2.2
Several improvements, added additional block types (rfn, cfn, cdo, rdo) and support for multilevel blockmodeling

November 15, 2012
Version: 0.2.2
Added posibility to differentially weight relations, block type and positions or based on specially designed weights.
Added additional block types in C the blocks are now limited to: "nul", "com", "reg", "cre", "rre","dnc"
Multicore support through package doParallel for function optRandomParC.

February 9, 2012
